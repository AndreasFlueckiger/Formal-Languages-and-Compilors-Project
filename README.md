# TaskLang Compiler

Welcome! This project is a **simple compiler** that understands a small language called **TaskLang**.  
The goal is to let a computer read and understand commands like:

```tasklang
task "Buy milk" priority = high;
complete "Buy milk";
print all;


# **What This Project Does**
Adds new tasks with a description, optional priority, and optional due date

Marks tasks as completed

Deletes tasks by name

Prints tasks based on filters:

print all;

print pending;

print high;
